# MongoDB and Mongoose

MongoDB is used to store data records for use by an application. It's a non-relational database, meaning it stores all associated data within one record (rather than across many preset tables, like a SQL database).

Mongo uses JSON as its storage structure, which makes it good for a backend database for JavaScript. Mongoose.js is a NPM module that allows you to write Mongo objects as you would in JavasScript.
