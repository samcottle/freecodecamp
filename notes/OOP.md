# Object Oriented Programming

Objects are things that you can observe and interact with. A car has wheels, a shop has items, and an object has properties.

Here's an example of what a two-legged duck called Dave would look like as a JavaScript object:

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Dave",
  numLegs: = 2
};
```

The properties within a JavaScript object can be accessed using, for example, dot notation.

```js
console.log("The duck is called " + duck.name + ", and it has " + duck.numLegs + " legs.")

// Prints "The duck is called Dave, and it has 2 legs." in the console.
```
